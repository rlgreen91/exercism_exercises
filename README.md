# Exercising Our Way Through Exercism
Take a look at my solutions for exercism!


This repo contains my solutions to various exercises on exercism.io. The
solutions are organized into folders by language, and each solution lives on
its own branch.  For example, if you want to find my solution to the Hello
World Javascript exercise, head to the ```/javascript``` folder and check out
the ```hello_world``` branch.

This repo is primarily to keep track of my efforts to hone my coding skills in
various languages.  As a result, I am not planning to accept any contributions.
If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel to make them on the code 
in the repo, or [here](http://exercism.io/rlgreen91) on my Exercism profile.

If you think my code is pretty neat, and you're interested in working with me
on something, please feel free to send me an email at <rlgreen91@gmail.com>.
